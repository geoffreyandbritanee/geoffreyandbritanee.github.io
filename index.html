						<h2>Our Story</h2>
						<div class="row body-text">
							<div class="col-md-6">
				
								We’ve known about each other for a while, but we first got to know each other better while playing games with mutual friends at a church retreat in 2010. Britanee started school at UW that fall and Geo would visit her in the music building all the time. It took her a while, but she eventually realized that he wasn’t visiting her and hanging out just because it was “convenient” for him to be around - he was actually interested! After almost a year and a half “hanging out”, we finally began dating on a windy day in March 2012 when we went to Gasworks park together. Since then, it’s been a whirlwind of graduating, job hunting, fellowship, ministry, and striving to build a relationship on God’s love for us. Four and a half years’ worth of dates later, he proposed on the same hill in front of friends and family. 
								<p class="proposal-header"><span style="font-size: 15pt; color: #ff5a5a" class="icon fa-heart"></span> Geoffrey</p>
				</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
			
								Geo had hinted to me that he was going to propose soon, so I kept on trying to guess when the day was. To my chagrin I was wrong every time, and he kept teasing me, so I gave up guessing! We ended up going on (what I thought was) a spontaneous, last minute date on a day when my out-of-town plans had been canceled. He took me out to Pike Place Market and the aquarium which I enjoyed thoroughly. I began to get suspicious when dinner was at a fancy restaurant and they had somehow had our reservations from two weeks earlier. On our way home after dinner, he suggested stopping off at Gasworks for a walk, and as we started walking he started talking to me about our relationship. That’s when I knew this was it... but I was unprepared for the group of family and friends that were around the corner on the hill. Everyone had a rose for me! As we made our way up the hill, I heard music, and at the top he got on one knee with the ring box in his hand! The rest, they say, is history.

								<a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org" target="_blank">Seattle Aquarium</a><br>
								On the date that Geo proposed, we went on a date at the Seattle Aquarium. Britanee is entranced by sharks and other big fish. What’s not to love here!

							<div class="col-sm-4" style="padding-bottom:20px">
								<a href="http://www.zoo.org" target="_blank">Woodland Park Zoo</a><br>
								One of the first places we enjoyed as a couple! We once took an over the top blurred-background photo together here that Britanee is still embarrassed about.
