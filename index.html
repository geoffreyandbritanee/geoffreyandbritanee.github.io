										<h2>Our Proposal Story</h2>
										
										<a href="reception">TEST LINK</a>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-6">Geo had hinted to me that he was going to propose soon, so I kept on trying to guess when the day was. To my chagrin I was wrong every time, and he kept teasing me, so I gave up guessing! We ended up going on (what I thought was) a spontaneous, last minute date on a day when my out-of-town plans had been canceled. He took me out to Pike Place Market and the aquarium which I enjoyed thoroughly. I began to get suspicious when dinner was at a fancy restaurant and they had somehow had our reservations from two weeks earlier. On our way home after dinner, he suggested stopping off at Gasworks for a walk, and as we started walking he started talking to me about our relationship. That’s when I knew this was it... but I was unprepared for the group of family and friends that were around the corner on the hill. Everyone had a rose for me! As we made our way up the hill, I heard music, and at the top he got on one knee with the ring box in his hand! The rest, they say, is history.

						<h2>Welcome to Seattle</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org" target="_blank">Seattle Aquarium</a><br>
								On the date that Geo proposed, we went on a date at the Seattle Aquarium. Britanee is entranced by sharks and other big fish. What’s not to love here!
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="http://www.zoo.org" target="_blank">Woodland Park Zoo</a><br>
								One of the first places we enjoyed together as a couple! We once took an over the top blurred-background photo together here that Britanee is still embarrassed about.
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="http://www.seafair.com/events" target="_blank">Seafair</a><br>
								This is one of the big festivals in Seattle that just so happens to be going on during the weekend of our wedding! It’s a great opportunity to join in some local fun.

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/gas-works-park" target="_blank">Gasworks Park</a><br>
								The place where we first started dating and  where we got engaged 4 years later. Also home to one of the best views in Seattle and an excellent place to watch the sunset!
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="http://pikeplacemarket.org" target="_blank">Pike Place Market</a><br>
								 The doughnut holes are for eating and the flowers are for making people happy. Make sure to visit the [in]famous gum wall and get a pastry at Piroshky Piroshky bakery!
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">
								<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/kerry-park" target="_blank">Kerry Park</a><br>
								Gives Gasworks a run for its money when it comes to a classic view of Seattle! Also nearby to Sushiland and Molly Moon’s Ice Cream, which is never a bad thing.
