										<h2>Our Proposal Story</h2>
										<div class="row body-text">
											<div class="col-md-6">
												
												Geo had hinted to me that he was going to propose soon, so I kept on trying to guess when the day was. To my chagrin I was wrong every time, and he kept teasing me, so I gave up guessing! We ended up going on (what I thought was) a spontaneous, last minute date on a day when my out-of-town plans had been canceled. He took me out to Pike Place Market and the aquarium which I enjoyed thoroughly. I began to get suspicious when dinner was at a fancy restaurant and they had somehow had our reservations from two weeks earlier. On our way home after dinner, he suggested stopping off at Gasworks for a walk, and as we started walking he started talking to me about our relationship. That’s when I knew this was it... but I was unprepared for the group of family and friends that were around the corner on the hill. Everyone had a rose for me! As we made our way up the hill, I heard music, and at the top he got on one knee with the ring box in his hand! The rest, they say, is history.

								<a href="http://www.zoo.org" target="_blank">Woodland Park Zoo</a><br>
